## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I'm going to continue learning how to use relative and absolute positioning. I'm also going to learn more about styling ::before and ::after pseudo elements. I struggled a bit with giving the underline effect on the links.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=our2WMvPegM) - This helped me learn how to give the links and underline effect when hovering.
